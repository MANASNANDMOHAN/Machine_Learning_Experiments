Machine Learning is an Ai domain where we extract patterns from the data ,analyze & visualize the data and make intelligent predictions on new data according to 
the pattern your machine has learnt.

## Experiments Overview

### 1. Linear Regression
- Implementation of simple linear regression on a dataset to predict a continuous target variable based on a single feature.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification tasks. Explore how logistic regression models can be applied to predict discrete outcomes.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
- Extension of linear regression to handle multiple independent variables. Explore the relationship between multiple features and the target variable.

### 4. Naive Bayes
- Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. Understand the basic principles of probabilistic classification.

### 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Implementation of a Support Vector Machine for both classification and regression tasks. Explore the use of different kernels and parameters.

## Datasets
- Each experiment utilizes a different dataset to demonstrate the model's performance and behavior on real-world data.
- Include brief descriptions of the datasets used, their sources, and any preprocessing steps performed.
